This program simulates a random walker using MPI (Message Passing Interface).

1.Process 0 (Walker) randomly moves left or right for 10 steps and sends its position.
2.Process 1 (Observer) receives and logs the walkerâ€™s position after each step.
3.The simulation models a simple one-dimensional random walk.
4.The program requires at least two processes to execute properly.
